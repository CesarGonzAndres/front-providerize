          My name is JR Arnold with Scholarship Landscaping.  I am a senior at Duke University and for the last nine years, I have been caring for yards in our area to save for college.  Although I started my business doing lawn mowing (a service that I no longer offer), I have since expanded to include everything from installing mulch to installing landscape designs.  I have worked to ensure that we keep low prices by maintaining minimal overhead and obtaining wholesale contracts.  Not only do I have years of experience, but I also have my father helping me to ensure that my work is of the highest quality.

          If you are interested in our services, please email me at JamesArnold@ScholarshipLandscaping.com
